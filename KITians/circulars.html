                    Soil Health Card Scheme is a scheme launched by the

                    Under the scheme, the government plans to issue soil
                    cards to farmers which will carry crop-wise
                    recommendations of nutrients and fertilisers required for
                    the individual farms to help farmers to improve
                    productivity through judicious use of inputs.
                    All soil samples are to be tested in various soil testing
                    labs across the country.
                    Thereafter the experts will analyse the strength and
                    weaknesses (micro-nutrients deficiency) of the soil and
                    suggest measures to deal with it.
                    The result and suggestion will be displayed in the cards.
                    The government plans to issue the cards to 14 crore
                    farmers
