          <div class="exhiinfo">
            "India's only Trade Fair specialized on Urban Farming" Smart Urban
            Farming Expo will be organized by SUFex from 24-25, March 2023 At
            Thayagaraj Stadium, INA, New Delhi, India Today, around the world,
            people are starting to grow food in the most untraditional places
            and spaces. Urban farming has become the new frontier in farming.
            From simple community vegetable gardens to providing healthy food to
            consumers in the nearby areas, with smart technology, urban farming
            can go anywhere. In metropolitan cities, where sufficient space is a
            luxury, urban farming can be a boon for the citizens and common
            masses. Lately, health concerns have further gravitated the focus of
            citizens at large for food safety, healthy environment and aesthetic
            surroundings. Urban Farming is the fastest growing industry within
            the farming industry with specific requirements not catered to by
            the normal farming shows. This leaves room for a show catering to
            this new group of farmers who grow their products in the middle of a
            city, on a balcony or a rooftop. SUFex aims to showcase the
            Technologies, Products, Services , Innovations and Designs of Urban
            Farming ,and will bring together all stakeholders of Urban Farming
            particularly for, Vertical Farming, Indoor Farming, Bee Farming,
            Landscaping and Gardening, Biofloc Fish Farming etc.
