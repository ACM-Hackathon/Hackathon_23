          >Urea fertilizer provides nitrogen, which promotes green leafy growth
          that not only makes your garden look lush, but is also important for
          photosynthesis. In general, urea will provide the most nitrogen at the
          lowest cost. It is easy to store and does not pose as a fire risk for
          long-term storage. Urea may be mixed with other fertilizers or may be
          applied on its own. For plants that love acidic soils, urea is one of
          the top fertilizers for acidifying soils. For gardeners who grow crops
          like corn, strawberries, blueberries and other heavy nitrogen feeders,
          urea will supply immediate and powerful applications of nitrogen.
          Although this urea is artificially produced, its composition is the
          same as that produced by the body. Manufactured urea fertilizer can,
          therefore, be considered an organic fertilizer. It contains large
          amounts of nitrogen, which is essential for healthy plant growth.
          Nitrogen - 46% N - Nitrogen:- promotes the growth of leaves and
          vegetation. Can be used For all types of Plants, Soil & Crops,
          flowers, fruits, & Vegetables <br /><br />
