        <div class="info text1">
          Aeroponics is the process of growing plants in an air or mist
          environment without the utilize of soil or an aggregate medium. The
          word “Aeroponic” is from the Greek meanings of aer and ponos.
          Aeroponics is a subset of hydroponics and works by suspending plant
          roots in the air and misting them with nutrient water. This method can
          provide a better level of control over the amount of water that is
          used throughout the growing process but may leave plant roots
          vulnerable to pathogens, if not carefully controlled. Aeroponic
          systems are additional cost-efficient than other systems. Because of
          the reduced volume of solution throughput, less water, and fewer
          nutrients are needed in the system at any given time compared to other
          nutrient delivery systems. The need for substrates is eliminated, as
          is the need for many moving parts.
          <ul>
            Advantages:-
            <li>Ease of working with plants</li>
            <li>
              Cost effective as you won't have to spend money for irrigation
              channels
            </li>
            <li>
              Aids in disease free cultivation as plant to plant contact is
              limited and even if a plant is affected it can be removed easily.

        <div class="info text2">
          The hydroponics method is a soil-less type of farming because it
          requires no soil for the plants to grow. Instead, it uses water as its
          growing medium. The knowledge of soil-less gardening is called
          hydroponics. It essentially involves growing healthy plants without
          the use of a traditional soil medium by using a nutrient like a
          mineral-rich water solution instead. A plant needs, choose nutrients,
          some water, and sunlight to grow. Not only do plants grow without
          soil, they often develop a lot better with their roots in water
          instead.The hydroponics farming method is a subset of hydroculture,
          which is a method of growing plants without soil by using mineral
          nutrient solutions in a water solvent. Terrestrial plants may be
          developed with only their roots exposed to the mineral solution, or
          the roots may be supported by an inert medium, such as perlite.
          <ul>
            Advantages:-
            <li>Reduced plant opposition for nutrients, space and sunlight</li>
            <li>Control of undesirable growth</li>
            <li>
              Reduction of costs by controlling specialized machinery required
              for operations

        <div class="info text3">
          A hybrid seed technology is a cross between two or more unrelated
          inbred plants. The two dissimilar varieties are cross bred, resulting
          in a seed that carries one or more favorable traits. Hybrid seeds are
          commonplace in commercial farming, mainly to increase crop yields. In
          agriculture and gardening, hybrid seed is used to form by
          cross-pollinated plants. Hybrid seed production is major in modern
          agriculture and home gardening. All of the hybrid seeds planted by the
          farmer will construct similar plants, while the seeds of the next
          generation from those hybrids will not consistently have the desired
          characteristics. Controlled hybrids provide very regular
          characteristics because they are produced by crossing two inbred
          strains.
          <ul>
            Advantages:-
            <li>Additional vigorous plants</li>
            <li>Enchanced disease resistance</li>
