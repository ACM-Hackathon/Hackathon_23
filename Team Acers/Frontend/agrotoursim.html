          <div class="coninfo">
            Agricultural tourism is a worldwide trend, which offers city
            dwellers a chance to escape urban concrete and re-discover their
            rural roots. Agricultural tourism is a relatively new market for
            tourists. The chance of interacting with individuals that one may
            not interact with on any level at any time involves the mystery that
            accompanies the occupation of this individual. The interaction of
            individuals with farm life also carries an educational aspect.
            People tend to enjoy learning about items and processes that they
            will not participate in directly. Agri-tourism or Agricultural
            tourism is becoming an important tourism development opportunities
            and more of the population have moved to the city and have lost
            their connection to where agriculture is produced “Agricultural
            Tourism” includes a set of economic and social activities that occur
            and link travel with the products, services, and experiences of
            agriculture. Agricultural tourism is a type of tourism that has seen
            a boost in popularity within recent years. It allows people to stay
            at fully functioning farms in order to observe the work routines and
            activities that are undergone in the agriculture business on a
            day-to-day basis. This is an excellent opportunity for many people
            to experience and learn about a lifestyle that is quite different
            than their own, often times in beautiful, peaceful, rustic settings.
            Agri-tourism is a subset of a larger industry called rural tourism
            that includes resorts, off-site farmers' markets, non-profit
            agricultural tours, and other leisure and hospitality businesses
            that attract visitors to the countryside. Rural Tourism differs from
            agri-tourism in two ways. First, rural tourism enterprises do not
            necessarily occur on a farm or at an agricultural plant, they do not
            generate supplemental income for the agricultural enterprise.

          <h2>WHY PROMOTE AGRO-TOURISM IN MAHARASHTRA?</h2>
          <p>
            Agriculture business is becoming more unsecured in the Maharashtra
            due to the irregular mansoon, unsecured product prices. Many farmers
            cannot afford it and have a problem of indebtedness. Due to the
            agricultural problems some farmers are committed to suicide in
            various districts of the Maharashtra. More than 29,000 farmers
            committed suicide between 1997 and 2005 in the Maharashtra, official
            data show, no other state comes close to that total. Hence, there is
            need of start any of allied agri-business to support their farming
            and create allied income source from farm. In order to encourage
            farmers for establish small and viable agro-business activity, such
            as agrotourism. It offers several potential benefits to farm
            operators. It can help supplement income generation activity while
            providing an opportunity to more fully employ assets, including farm
            household members. The Maharashtra has a great potential of
            agro-tourism due to the beautiful natural site and basic
            infrastructures.
